# Before Getting Started

The starting code for this project includes all the JSX/logic of using the hook already. The only thing you need to do is implement the `useFetch` hook and import it into the `App.jsx` file. Also, the code for the bonus section of the course is included but just commented out so you can uncomment those lines whenever you tackle the bonus sections.

If the API used in this video is no longer available or does not work just uncomment the `URLS` object at the top of the file to use the local JSON files in the `public` folder.

This project should hopefully be fairly easy for you as it is just taking everything we have done with fetch and putting it into a custom hook.

# Instructions

1. Create a custom `useFetch` hook that returns an object with the following data:
   - `status` - Will be "idle" when the request is not running, "loading" while it is fetching, "error" if the fetch request fails, and "fetched" if the fetch request is successful
   - `error` - Will contain the error object if there is an error
   - `data` - Will contain the data from the fetch request

## Bonus

1. Add the ability to pass down an `options` object to the `useFetch` hook that will set the options for the fetch request.
   - If you are using the local files instead of the API you will not see any difference in the output when passing these custom options just because of the limitations of not actually calling an API on a server.
2. Add in the proper cleanup functionality for aborting a request if a new request is triggered before the old one finishes.
