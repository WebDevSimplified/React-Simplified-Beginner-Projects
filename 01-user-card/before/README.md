# Before Getting Started

If you want you can open the `user.html` file in your browser to see what the final version of this application should look like. Your application should match the output exactly to what the `user.html` file renders.

All of the CSS is already provided for you along with the appropriate class names in the HTML so you shouldn't need to write any CSS or move any of the class names around.


# Instructions

1. Initialize a Vite app or use Create React App
2. Remove all unnecessary code
3. Import the CSS/JSON files into your App.jsx
4. Create a `UserCard` function component that takes in `name`, `phoneNumber`, `age`, and `address` props and has the same HTML as the `user.html` file.
5. Pass the user information into the `UserCard` component from the `App.jsx` file
6. Try manually changing the data in the `user.json` file to test that everything is hooked up properly
7. Repeat steps 4-6 but with a class component instead of a function component
